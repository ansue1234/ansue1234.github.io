If you are crunched on time, feel free to [click here for my resume](../../resume/) or go to the [contact](../Contact/) page to reach out to me if you have any questions!\r\n\r\n[sda;f](#projects)\r\n\r\n## A Bit About Me\r\nGlad that you wish to spend more time to learn about me! \r\n\r\nI am Andrew Sue, a second year undergraduate Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) student at University of California, Berkeley. \r\n\r\nI am very passionate about programming and electronics and overall just love building random things from LEGOs and poker card towers to my own signal generator. I really enjoy the feel when I can solve problems (except test questions) by applying things I learned. Hence, I am eagered to build on and learn more!\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am working with a few friends of mine on a hardware + software system that can help remind parents when they accidentally left their baby in their cars. If you like to learn more about this project or other projects I created, [click here](../projects/)!\r\n\r\nAside from electronics and computers, I also enjoy landscaping and doing Chinese Calligraphy. So, if you don't find me next to my computer or soldering iron, you will probably see me fiddling with a brush or playing with dirt in my backyard.\r\n\r\nNow on a more serious note:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n* University of California, Berkeley \r\n* City College of San Francisco\r\n\r\n## Relevant Coursework\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n \r\n### Hardware Related\r\n\r\n### Software Related\r\n\r\n### Languages \r\n#### _Human Languages_\r\n* Mandarin (Fluent, able to converse, read and write)\r\n* Cantonese (Fluent, able to converse, read and write)\r\n* French (Intermediate, able to converse, read and write)\r\n  \r\n#### _Programming Languages_\r\nJava, Python, Javascript, C, C++, C#, RISC-V Assembly, Dart, HTML, CSS\r\n\r\n## Work Experience\r\n\r\n## Organizations and Extracurriculars\r\n\r\n## Projects \r\nFor a complete list of my projects, please go to [Projects](../projects/)!"}}}]}}}
