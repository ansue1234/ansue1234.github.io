I agree it is a bit to read here. If you are crunched on time, feel free to [click here for my resume](../../resume/) or go to the [contact](../Contact/) page to reach out to me if you have any questions!

## A Bit About Me
Glad that you wish to spend more time to learn about me! 

I am Andrew Sue, a second year undergraduate Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) student at University of California, Berkeley. 

I am very passionate about programming and electronics and overall just love building random things from LEGOs and poker card towers to my own signal generator. I really enjoy the feel when I can solve problems (except test questions) by applying things I learned. Hence, I am eagered to build on and learn more!

Currently, I am working with a few friends of mine on a hardware + software system that can help remind parents when they accidentally left their baby in their cars. If you like to learn more about [this project](../projects/HIP/) or other projects I created, [click here](../../projects/)!

Aside from electronics and computers, I also enjoy landscaping, doing Chinese Calligraphy and ocasionally plays the harmonica. So, if you don't find me next to my computer or soldering iron, you will probably see me fiddling with a brush, playing with dirt in my backyard or contributing to the sound pollution.

Now on a more serious note:

* Lowell High School (2015-2019)

## Relevant Coursework

### Computer Science
* Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems-[CS170](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS170/)
  * **Description**: This is a computer science theory class that focus on the algorithmic analysis and design of various algorithms based on well known ones such as Huffman Encoding and techniques such as Divide and Conquer.
  * **Topics Covered**: Divide and Conquer, Graph Traversal and Searches, Greedy Algorithms, Fast Fourier Transform, Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, Network Flows, Duality, NP-completeness, Reductions, Approximation Algorithms, Intro to Quantum Algorithms
* Introduction to Artificial Intelligence-[CS188](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS188/)
  * **Description**: This class is focuses on introducing the basics of many subfields of artificial intelligence from uninformed searches to neural networks with a little emphasize on reinforcement learning.
  * **Topics Covered**: Uninformed Search (BFS, BFS, etc.), Informed Search(A* Search, etc.), Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Minimax, Markov Decision Process, Markov Chains, Methods of Reinforcement Learning, Bayesian Inference, Monte Carlo Methods, Neural Networks.
* Data Structures-[CS61B](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS61B/)
  * **Description**: This class is mainly on the implementations, usage and theory behind basic data structures such as link lists, queues, heaps graphs and etc. using Java. Due to the nature of this class, I was required to build programs around 1500 lines of code as part of the curiculum and hence learn a lot about the software design process and workflow in this class too.
  * **Topics Covered**: Trees, Queues, Heaps, Linked lists, Graphs, Graph traversal algorithms, Big O notation, Hashing, Various sorting and searching algorithms, Basics of Java, OOP
* Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures) -[CS61C](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS61C/)
  * **Description**: This class is essentially a computer architecture class structured around 6 "great ideas" of computer architecture(Abstraction, Moore's Law, Principal of Locality, Parallelism, Performance Measurement and Improvement, Dependability via Redundancy) taught in C and RISC-V 
  * **Topics Covered**: Basics of C, Basics of RISC-V Assembly, Digital Circuit Design, Caches, Memory Hierarchy, Spark 
* Introduction to Machine Learning-[CS189](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS189/)    _Currently taking_
### Electrical Engineering
* Microfabrication Technology-[EE143](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EE143/)
  * **Description**: This class focuses on the design of fabrication process of microelectrical devices such as MOSFETs from photolithography to packaging
  * **Topics Covered**: Photolithography, Etching, Oxidation, Doping, Evaporation/Sputtering, MOSFET Fabrication process, Working principles behind MOSFETs, Fabrication Process Design. 
* Designing Information Devices and Systems I,II-[EE16A](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EE16A/),[EE16B](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EE16B/)
  * **Description**: This series of classes is aimed to introduce the different subfields of Electrical Engineering from analog circuit design to control systems for robotics. Due to the nature of the material, there is also an heavy emphasize on linear algebra and differential equations.
  * **Topics Covered**: Op-Amp theory and usage, MOSFET usage, RLC circuits, Theory involving oscillatory states, linear algebra, differential equations, least square algorithm, Principle Component Analysis, SVD, Feedback Control Systems, 
* Signal and Systems-[EE120](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EE120/)    _Currently taking_
