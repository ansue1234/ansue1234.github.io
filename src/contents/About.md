## A Bit About Me
Glad that you wish to spend more time to learn about me! 

I am Andrew Sue, a second year undergraduate Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) student at University of California, Berkeley. 

I am very passionate about programming and electronics and overall just love building random things from LEGOs and poker card towers to my own signal generator. I really enjoy the feel when I can solve problems (except test questions) by applying things I learned. Hence, I am eagered to build on and learn more!

Currently, I am working with a few friends of mine on a hardware + software system that can help remind parents when they accidentally left their baby in their cars. If you like to learn more about this project or other projects I created, [click here](../../projects/)!

Aside from electronics and computers, I also enjoy landscaping and doing Chinese Calligraphy. So, if you don't find me next to my computer or soldering iron, you will probably see me fiddling with a brush or playing with dirt in my backyard.

Now on a more serious note:
