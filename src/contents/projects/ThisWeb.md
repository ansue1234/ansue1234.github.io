## Description

This website! Feel free to browse around!

## Approach
This website is built using React and Gatsby. I started off from following the Gatsby hello world tutorial and used its templates as my starting point. Then I used a variety of resources and piece them together to form this website. I hope to use this website to showcase my projects, achievements, and as a sandbox to tryout different UI libraries and various designs. One thing I plan to add in the future is to probably include some animations to make everything more lively!
