## Description
This is a class project for Berkeley's computer architecture class CS61C. 

In this project we are required to build a fully functional CPU with RISC-V data path in the circuit simulator Logism that is capable of running machine code that is converted from RISC-V assembly code. This project provided me an in-depth understanding behind the parts of the CPU, the different stages of data path and the implementation and workings of pipelining to increase throughput. Starting off from just basic logic gates and registers, I built and wired a complete CPU, truely built a computer from scratch.
